# FPL Toolkit Season-Ready Enhancements

## üéØ Summary of Enhancements for Season Start

This update significantly enhances the FPL Toolkit to address @AmberMaze's requirements for the season starting tomorrow, with improved AI capabilities, official FPL API integration, and comprehensive scenario planning.

## üöÄ Major Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced FPL API Client (`src/fpl_toolkit/api/client.py`)
**NEW ENDPOINTS ADDED:**
- `get_user_team(team_id)` - Get user's team information
- `get_team_picks(team_id, gameweek)` - Get team picks for specific gameweek  
- `get_team_transfers(team_id)` - Get transfer history
- `get_league_standings(league_id)` - Get league standings
- `get_dream_team(gameweek)` - Get official dream team
- `get_live_gameweek(gameweek)` - Get live gameweek data with player scores

**COMPLIANCE WITH OFFICIAL API:**
‚úÖ All endpoints follow the official FPL API structure from the Medium guide
‚úÖ Enhanced caching with appropriate TTL for live vs static data
‚úÖ Proper error handling and timeouts

### 2. AI-Powered Advisor with Hugging Face (`src/fpl_toolkit/ai/advisor.py`)
**ADAPTIVE & INTELLIGENT:**
- **Season Context Awareness**: Dynamically adjusts thresholds based on early/mid/late season
- **Hugging Face Integration**: Uses multiple models for enhanced analysis:
  - `sentence-transformers` for player similarity analysis
  - `transformers` pipeline for sentiment analysis  
  - Graceful fallback when models unavailable
- **AI-Enhanced Player Analysis**: 
  - Semantic similarity for finding player alternatives
  - Sentiment analysis for player context
  - Adaptive performance thresholds based on gameweek
- **Severity Scoring**: AI-driven severity scores for transfer priorities

**KEY METHODS:**
- `detect_underperformers()` - Now with AI sentiment and adaptive thresholds
- `find_similar_players()` - Uses embeddings for intelligent player matching
- `_get_adaptive_thresholds()` - Dynamic thresholds by season phase
- `_analyze_player_sentiment()` - AI sentiment analysis

### 3. Comprehensive Scenario Planner (`src/fpl_toolkit/ai/scenario_planner.py`)
**GAMEWEEK PLANNING:**
- **5 Scenario Types**:
  1. Conservative (no transfers)
  2. Single transfer (best value)
  3. Double transfer (if available)
  4. Aggressive (hit for high gains)
  5. Fixture-based (next 3 GWs)

**WEEKLY STRATEGY:**
- `plan_weekly_strategy()` - Plan 4 weeks ahead
- `plan_gameweek_scenarios()` - Generate optimized scenarios
- `compare_scenarios()` - AI-powered scenario ranking

### 4. Enhanced CLI Commands (`src/fpl_toolkit/cli.py`)
**NEW COMMANDS FOR TEAM MANAGEMENT:**

```bash
# Fetch and analyze any FPL team
fpl-toolkit team 12345

# Generate scenarios for team planning  
fpl-toolkit scenarios 12345 --scenarios 5

# Get weekly strategy for upcoming gameweeks
fpl-toolkit weekly 12345 --weeks 4

# Enhanced advice with scenarios and AI analysis
fpl-toolkit advise 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 --scenarios --weekly
```

**FEATURES:**
- Real-time team fetching from FPL API
- AI-powered scenario generation
- Weekly gameweek planning
- Enhanced advice with season context

### 5. Enhanced Dependencies (`pyproject.toml`)
**HUGGING FACE ECOSYSTEM:**
- `transformers>=4.30.0` - For sentiment analysis and NLP
- `sentence-transformers>=2.2.0` - For player embeddings
- `numpy>=1.24.0` - For similarity calculations
- `torch>=2.0.0` - For model inference
